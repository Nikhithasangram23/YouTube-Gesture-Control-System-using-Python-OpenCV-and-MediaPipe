# YouTube-Gesture-Control-System-using-Python-OpenCV-and-MediaPipE

Introduction
This project is a real-time YouTube Gesture Control System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It enables hands-free interaction with YouTube videos by recognizing hand gestures to perform actions like Play, Pause, Next, and Previous. The system leverages computer vision and automation tools (PyAutoGUI) to provide a seamless and accessible user experience.
Key Features
•	Real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
•	Control YouTube with gestures: Play, Pause, Next, Previous.
•	Automation with PyAutoGUI ensures smooth interaction.
•	Enhances accessibility with hands-free video control.
Tech Stack
•	Python
•	OpenCV – for video processing
•	MediaPipe – for hand gesture recognition
•	PyAutoGUI – for automating YouTube controls
▶️ Usage
1.	Open YouTube in your browser.
2.	Run the script:
python youtube_gestures.py
3.	Show gestures in front of your webcam:
o	✋ Palm Open → Play Video
o	✊ Fist → Pause Video

Future Enhancements:
•	Cross-Platform Media Control – Extend beyond YouTube to platforms like Netflix, Spotify, VLC Media Player, and Zoom.
•	Touchless PC Control – Extend functionality to system-level actions (volume, brightness, app switching).
•	Voice + Gesture Hybrid Control – Combine voice commands with hand gestures for a smarter and seamless interaction.

# YouTube-Gesture-Control-System-using-Python-OpenCV-and-MediaPipE

Introduction

This project is a real-time YouTube Gesture Control System developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It enables hands-free interaction with YouTube videos by recognizing hand gestures to perform actions like Play, Pause, Next, and Previous. The system leverages computer vision and automation tools (PyAutoGUI) to provide a seamless and accessible user experience.

Key Features

•Real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.

•Control YouTube with gestures: Play, Pause, Next, Previous.

•Automation with PyAutoGUI ensures smooth interaction.

•Enhances accessibility with hands-free video control.

Tech Stack

•Python

•OpenCV – for video processing

•MediaPipe – for hand gesture recognition

•PyAutoGUI – for automating YouTube controls

▶️ Usage

Future Enhancements:

•Cross-Platform Media Control – Extend beyond YouTube to platforms like Netflix, Spotify, VLC Media Player, and Zoom.

•Touchless PC Control – Extend functionality to system-level actions (volume, brightness, app switching).

•Voice + Gesture Hybrid Control – Combine voice commands with hand gestures for a smarter and seamless interaction.
